# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the HTML5 and CSS section of Free Code Camp's Front End Dev Certification within a little over an hour.

**Thoughts:** I feel like going from CS50X to this made doing it a breeze. I remember when I tried to do FCC a long time ago and felt like I was just memorizing things for the sake of memorizing them or getting stuck in the most basic of syntax (curly braces, semicolons and quotation marks).That was two years ago and I didn't remember anything. I was learning all over again, but this time picking up on everything significantly faster.

### Day 1: Tuesday, July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the jQuery and Bootstrap sections of FCC again within a little over an hour. Took notes on CS50X's shorts on Dynamic Memory Allocation, Structures and Type Definitions.

**Thoughts:** First, once again the tutorials flew by, but I'm nervous for tomorrow's first challenge to actually build something using CodePen. Second, the online FCC and #100DaysOfCode community is so welcoming that I can confirm that yes, by going public and committing to the challenge I am definitely receiving more encouragement and accountability, and feeling more motivated for sure. 

### Day 2: Wednesday, July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began the first Basic Front End Dev Project for FCC, a Tribute Page using CodePen. After spending the first hour that morning trying to decide on the person, I finally settled on Amy Winehouse.
