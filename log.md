# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the HTML5 and CSS section of Free Code Camp's Front End Dev Certification within a little over an hour.

**Thoughts:** I feel like going from CS50X to this made doing it a breeze. I remember when I tried to do FCC a long time ago and felt like I was just memorizing things for the sake of memorizing them or getting stuck in the most basic of syntax (curly braces, semicolons and quotation marks).That was two years ago and I didn't remember anything. I was learning all over again, but this time picking up on everything significantly faster.
